# AddOnTemplates

Simple World of Warcraft AddOn designed to allow the user to save templates of
their current AddOn enablement state to quickly switch from one to another. The
idea being, if they use a lot of AddOns, as I do, they'll want some enabled while
leveling, others enabled while in the open world and still others while raiding.

#### Warning

This is my first AddOn, is still developement, and was developed with WotLK in
mind and the focused test environment.
